🚀 What I Do
 
Nearly all my projects are built through low-code development via Vibe Coding — an efficient and innovative paradigm I firmly believe will become mainstream. I’m passionate about creating practical, fun small tools and software to share with the community. Recently, I’ve been diving deep into web development on my personal NAS server, exploring how to build and deploy web apps in a self-hosted environment.
 
I’m actively expanding my programming fundamentals while continuing to hone my Vibe Coding skills. My goal is to keep sharing useful projects and growing alongside fellow developers!
